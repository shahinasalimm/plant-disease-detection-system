# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

A deep learning-based web application for detecting diseases in tomato leaves. This project uses a *pre-trained MobileNetV2* model for image classification, wrapped in a simple Flask web interface that allows users to upload tomato leaf images and receive disease predictions.

## Features

- Upload tomato leaf images for instant disease detection
- Utilizes a pre-trained *MobileNetV2* architecture
- Lightweight and accurate deep learning model
- Web interface built using Flask
- Includes data analysis and model evaluation scripts

## Dataset

The model is trained on a publicly available tomato leaf disease dataset.
